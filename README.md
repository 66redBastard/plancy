# Plancy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.

I've installed `eslint + prettier` for linting and code formatting.

Tried to use SCSS modules like OOSCSS. Just more practicing is needed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Problems ( not critical ).

Scss needs refactoring. 

Bootstrap 5 used for Auth and Admin panel.

Simple one star animation added.

Gradient background blurs are not implemented. 

Two Slider SVG Icons are damaged a lil bit. Dunno, what's wrong. Need to chat with a designer.

got Initial Chunk Files and Lazy Chunk Files up to 5.6 MB. Need to read about dis.

PS: I've enjoed my coding nights for sure. Great challange. 
perhaps, I'll try to deploy this app on AWS.
